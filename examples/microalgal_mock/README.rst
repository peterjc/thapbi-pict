Introduction
============

Data source
-----------

This example is based on the 18S rRNA amplicon library from this paper:

    Bradley *et al.* (2016) Design and Evaluation of Illumina MiSeq-Compatible,
    18S rRNA Gene-Specific Primers for Improved Characterization of Mixed
    Phototrophic Communities.
    https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01630-16
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA314977

There are 124 sequenced samples, giving 248 paired FASTQ files, taking about
1.4GB on disk.

Referring to Table 1 in the paper, for the V4 target region they used
Reuk454FWD1/V4r primer pair (``CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC`` and
``ACTTTCGTTCTTGAT``), while for the V8-V9 target they used the V8f/1510r pair
(``ATAACAGGTCTGTGATGCCCT`` and ``CCTTCYGCAGGTTCACCTAC``). However, the FASTQ
files provided have already been primer trimmed.

This means we need to run THAPBI PICT twice (once for each primer pair,
against a different marker database each time).

Provided files
--------------

Either clone the THAPBI PICT source code repository, or decompress the
latest source code release (``.tar.gz`` file). You should find it contains
a directory ``examples/microalgal_mock/`` which is for this example.

File ``PRJNA314977.txt`` was download from the ENA and includes the FASTQ
checksums, URLs, and sample metadata.

File ``metadata.tsv`` contains metadata about the samples (see below).

File ``mock_community.fasta`` contains the sequences from accession numbers
KU900218 to KU900229 (published with the paper), with the description line
holding just the assigned species.

Files ``mock_community.known.tsv``, ``mock_freshwater.known.tsv`` and
``mock_marine.known.tsv`` describe the expected 12 species in the mock
community (and six species mixes at the purely freshwater or purely marine
extremes).

Shell scripts ``setup.py`` and ``run.sh`` should reproduce the analysis
discussed in the THAPBI PICT documentation.

Setup
-----

We assume you have aquired the THAPBI PICT source code, and have your command
line terminal open in the ``examples/microalgal_mock/`` folder. First we run
the ``setup.py`` script:

.. code:: console

   $ ./setup.py

This will download the raw gzip compressed FASTQ files from the ENA (248 files,
124 pairs, about 1.4GB in total), and setup appropriate per-sample symlinks to
the expected output in the ``expected/`` sub-directories for use with classifier
assessment.

If you have the ``md5sum`` tool installed (standard on Linux), verify the FASTQ
files downloaded correctly:

.. code:: console

   $ cd V4/raw_data/
   $ md5sum -c MD5SUM.txt
   $ cd ../../

.. code:: console

   $ cd V8V9/raw_data/
   $ md5sum -c MD5SUM.txt
   $ cd ../../

There is no need to decompress the files.

Running the pipeline
--------------------

Next, you can run the ``run.py`` script which will call THAPBI PICT multiple times.
There is a subdirectory for each of the primer settings, ``V4/`` and ``V8V9/``.
For each it will make a simple database using the provided twelve 18S rRNA genes
in ``mock_community.fasta`` file, and call the pipeline.

Metadata
--------

The provided file ``metadata.tsv`` is based on Supplementary Material Table S2,
although consistently using just one row per sample (representing three replicates),
and with the location and mock community ratio split into separate columns. This
has been combined with the MiSeq accessions from ``PRJNA314977.txt``.

The amplicon specific files ``metadata.tsv`` have seven columns:

1. Environment, "Freshwater", "Wastewater", "Marine", "Control" or "Mock community"
2. Sample, e.g. "3F" or "MC4" with letters from environment, without replicate suffix
3. Description, e.g. "marsh" or "ocean"
4. Location, e.g. "Bray's Bayou, TX"
5. Freshwater:Marine, ratio for mock communities, e.g. "1:100"
6. V4 MiSeq, semi-colon separated list of three SRR accessions.
7. V8V9 MiSeq, semi-colon separated list of three SRR accessions.

Note that rather than providing separate files for the V4 and V8V9 sequencing,
they have been given separate cross-reference columns. Where a replicate is
missing, "Undetermined" is listed rather than an SRR accession.

When calling THAPBI PICT, the meta data commands are given as follows for V4:

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict ... -t metadata.tsv -c 1,2,3,4,5 -x 6

And as follows for V8V9:

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict ... -t metadata.tsv -c 1,2,3,4,5 -x 7

Argument ``-t metadata.tsv`` says to use this file for the metadata.

Argument ``-c 1,2,3,4,5`` says which columns to display and sort by. This means
Environment, Sample, Description, Location, Freshwater:Marine. This sorting
groups the samples logically (although it would be preferable to have the mock
community listed first or last, and "10W" appears before "2W").

Argument ``-x 6`` or ``-x 7`` indicates the V4 or V8V9 filename stems can be
found in that column respectively.

We have not given a ``-g`` argument to assign colour bands in the Excel
reports, so it will default to the first column in ``-c``, meaning we get
coloured bands for "Freshwater", "Wastewater", "Mock community" and "Marine".
