This example is based on a subset of the data described here:

    Walker *et al.* (2019)
    A fecal sequel: Testing the limits of a genetic assay for bat species
    identification.
    https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224969
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA574765

The COI reference sequences are from Supplementary S2 in the preceding paper:

    Walker *et al.* (2016)
    Species From Feces: Order-Wide Identification of Chiroptera From Guano and
    Other Non-Invasive Genetic Samples.
    https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0162342
