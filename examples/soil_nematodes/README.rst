This example is based on:

    Ahmed *et al.* (2019) Metabarcoding of soil nematodes: the importance of
    taxonomic coverage and availability of reference sequences in choosing
    suitable marker(s)
    https://doi.org/10.3897/mbmg.3.36408

It will download 32 raw FASTQ files (16 pairs), covering four markers
sequenced separately, taking about 12 GB on disk.
