This example is based on:

    Landa *et al.* (2021) Diversity of Phytophthora Species Detected in
    Disturbed and Undisturbed British Soils Using High-Throughput Sequencing
    Targeting ITS rRNA and COI mtDNA Regions.
    https://doi.org/10.3390/f12020229
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA690943

It will download 202 FASTQ files (101 pairs) of ITS1 data taking about 200MB
on disk.

The example currently ignores PRJNA691575 which is the COI data, 135 pairs of
FASTQ files, taking about 1.3GB on disk.
