This example is based on:

    Batovska *et al.* (2021) Developing a non-destructive metabarcoding
    protocol for detection of pest insects in bulk trap catches

It will download 60 raw FASTQ files (30 pairs, of which 20 are mock
communities of up to six species, and 10 are field trap samples), covering
three pooled markers (18S, 12S, COI), taking about 7.9 GB on disk.
