This folder contains multiple examples for use with THAPBI PICT, each with
their own ``README.rst`` file for context (part of a larger set of worked
example documentation).

You can use the ``setup_all.sh`` to download and setup all the raw data,
and likewise ``run_all.sh`` to general all the intermediate files and the
output reports.

See https://thapbi-pict.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/ for discussion of
these examples.
