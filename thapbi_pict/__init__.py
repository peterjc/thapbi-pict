"""THAPBI *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classifier Tool (PICT).

*Phytophthora* (from Greek meaning plant-destroyer) species are economically
important plant pathogens, important in both agriculture and forestry. ITS1 is
short for Internal Transcribed Spacer one, which is a region of eukaryotes
genomes between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes. This is commonly used for
molecular barcoding, where sequencing this short region can identify species.

This Python package provides ITS1-based diagnostic/profiling tools for the
Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI) Phyto-Threats project,
which is supported by a grant funded jointly by the Biotechnology and
Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural affairs (DEFRA), the Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC), the Forestry Commission, and the Natural Environment Research Council
(NERC) and the Scottish Government, under the Tree Health and Plant
Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI).
