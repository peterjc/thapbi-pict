"""Helper code to get command line tool versions.

Defines various functions to check a tool is on the ``$PATH`` and if so,
return the tool version as a short string (sometimes including a date).

These functions are called from various THAPBI-PICT subcommands which call
external tools to ensure a clear missing dependency message, and to log the
version of the external tool used.

If the tool is not on the path, the commands all return None.

If we cannot parse the output, again the commands return None - which is
likely an indication of a major version change, meaning the tool ought to be
re-evaluated for use with THAPBI-PICT.
