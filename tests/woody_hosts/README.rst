Test case based on worked example
=================================

See ``examples/woody_hosts/`` and the main documentation. This example is
based on the following paper:

* Riddell et al (2019) Metabarcoding reveals a high diversity of woody
  host-associated Phytophthora spp. in soils at public gardens and amenity
  woodlands in Britain. https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6931

The raw FASTQ files are too large to include with the THAPBI PICT source code,
and thus be used in continuous integration testing. However, we provide file
``intermediate.tar.bz2`` which is a compressed archive of all 122 intermediate
FASTA files, which is useful for testing.
