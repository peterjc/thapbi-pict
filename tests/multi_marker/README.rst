Test case based on worked example
=================================

See ``examples/endangered_species/`` and the main documentation. This example
is based on the following paper:

    Arulandhu *et al.* (2017) Development and validation of a multi-locus DNA
    metabarcoding method to identify endangered species in complex samples.
    https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/gix080
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB18620
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB18620/

We have included a 0.1% sampling of the EM_1 sample (ERR1823567), which still
gives meaningful output for four of the markers at a minimum abundance
threshold of 10 reads.
