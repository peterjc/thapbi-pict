THAPBI *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classifier Tool (PICT)
=================================================

THAPBI PICT an ITS1-based diagnostic/profiling tool from the UK
`BBSRC <https://www.bbsrc.ac.uk>`__ funded Tree Health and Plant
Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI) Phyto-Threats project, focused on
identifying *Phytophthora* species present in Illumina sequenced
environmental samples.

*Phytophthora* (from Greek meaning plant-destroyer) species are
economically important plant pathogens, important in both agriculture
and forestry. ITS1 is short for Internal Transcribed Spacer one, which
is a region of eukaryotes genomes between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes.
This is commonly used for molecular barcoding, where sequencing this
short region can identify species.
