THAPBI *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classifier Tool (PICT)
=================================================

THAPBI PICT is a sequence based diagnostic/profiling tool from the UK funded
Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI) `Phyto-Threats project
<https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/research/global-threats-from-phytophthora-spp/>`_,
initially focused on identifying *Phytophthora* species present in Illumina
sequenced environmental samples.

*Phytophthora* (from Greek meaning plant-destroyer) species are economically
important plant pathogens, in both agriculture and forestry. ITS1 is short for
Internal Transcribed Spacer one, which is a region of eukaryotes genomes
between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes. This is commonly used for molecular
barcoding, where sequencing this short region can identify species.

With appropriate primer settings and a custom database of full length markers,
THAPBI PICT can be applied to other organisms and/or barcode marker sequences
- not just *Phytophthora* ITS1. It requires overlapping paired-end Illumina
reads which can be merged to cover the *full* amplicon marker. Longer markers
or fragmented amplicons are not supported. Internally it works by tracking
unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), using MD5 checksums as identifiers.

The worked examples include oomycetes, fungi, fish, bats, and plants, and
cover markers in ITS1, ITS2, 12S, 16S, COI, and more. The main criteria has
been mock communities with known species composition.

The THAPBI Phyto-Threats project was initially supported by a grant funded
jointly by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (`BBSRC
<https://bbsrc.ukri.org/>`_), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
affairs (`DEFRA <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs>`_),
the Economic and Social Research Council (`ESRC <https://esrc.ukri.org>`_),
the `Forestry Commission <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission>`_,
the Natural Environment Research Council (`NERC <https://nerc.ukri.org>`_)
and the `Scottish Government <https://www.gov.scot/>`_, under the Tree
Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI).
