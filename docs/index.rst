THAPBI *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classifier Tool (PICT)
=================================================

THAPBI PICT is a sequence based diagnostic/profiling tool from the UK funded
Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI) `Phyto-Threats project
<https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/research/global-threats-from-phytophthora-spp/>`_,
focused on identifying *Phytophthora* species present in Illumina sequenced
environmental samples.

*Phytophthora* (from Greek meaning plant-destroyer) species are
economically important plant pathogens, important in both agriculture
and forestry. ITS1 is short for Internal Transcribed Spacer one, which
is a region of eukaryotes genomes between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes.
This is commonly used for molecular barcoding, where sequencing this
short region can identify species.

With appropriate primer and HMM settings, and a custom database, THAPBI PICT
can be applied to other organisms and/or barcode marker sequences - not just
ITS1.

The THAPBI Phyto-Threats project is supported by a grant funded jointly by the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (`BBSRC
<https://bbsrc.ukri.org/>`_), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
affairs (`DEFRA <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs>`_),
the Economic and Social Research Council (`ESRC <https://esrc.ukri.org>`_),
the `Forestry Commission <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission>`_,
the Natural Environment Research Council (`NERC <https://nerc.ukri.org>`_)
and the `Scottish Government <https://www.gov.scot/>`_, under the Tree
Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI).
