THAPBI *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classifier Tool (PICT)
=================================================

THAPBI PICT is an ITS1-based diagnostic/profiling tool from the UK funded Tree
Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI) `Phyto-Threats project
<https://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/research/global-threats-from-phytophthora-spp/>`_,
focused on identifying *Phytophthora* species present in Illumina sequenced
environmental samples.

*Phytophthora* (from Greek meaning plant-destroyer) species are
economically important plant pathogens, important in both agriculture
and forestry. ITS1 is short for Internal Transcribed Spacer one, which
is a region of eukaryotes genomes between the 18S and 5.8S rRNA genes.
This is commonly used for molecular barcoding, where sequencing this
short region can identify species.

The THAPBI Phyto-Threats project is supported by a grant funded jointly by the
Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (`BBSRC
<https://bbsrc.ukri.org/>`_), the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
affairs (`DEFRA <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs>`_),
the Economic and Social Research Council (`ESRC <https://esrc.ukri.org>`_),
the `Forestry Commission <https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/forestry-commission>`_,
the Natural Environment Research Council (`NERC <https://nerc.ukri.org>`_)
and the `Scottish Government <https://www.gov.scot/>`_, under the Tree
Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (THAPBI).
