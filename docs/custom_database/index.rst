Worked Example
==============

The first :ref:``../worked_exmple`` applied the default analysis pipeline
to some real *Phytophthora* ITS1 data from woody-host trees, using the
same PCR primers as the THAPBI PICT defaults, and with the default database
of *Phytophthora* ITS1 data the tool provides.

Here we re-analyse a published dataset from a different group, doing Illumina
MiSeq ITS1 amplicon sequencing of irrigation water samples from Oregon. This
covers more than just *Phytophthora*.
