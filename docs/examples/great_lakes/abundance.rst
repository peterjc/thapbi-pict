Minimum Abundance Threshold
===========================

THAPBI PICT has a default minimum absolute abundance threshold of 100 reads
per marker per sample, and 0.1% of the reads per marker per sample, before
accepting any unique sequence. Background contamination and PCR noise levels
will vary, so having multiple :ref:`negative_controls` will help set this
objectively.

In this dataset there is a single negative control for the MOL16S marker,
library ``BIM8M`` aka ``SRR5534986``. However, we can also treat all the
SPH16S libraries as negative controls for the MOL16S marker, and vice versa.
You could do this automatically within THAPBI PICT via the ``-n`` or
``--negctrls`` command line option, but as we shall see in this example it
will discard most of the data.

In order to examine an appropriate minimum abundance threshold, the ``run.sh``
script provided uses ``-a 10 -f 0`` to accept any unique sequence seen in
sample at least ten times (regardless the fraction of the sample read total).
This *does* allow unwanted noise though to the reports.

SPH16S
------

This was the more specific primer pair, expected to only amplify sphaeriid
mussel species, so in general we expect less unique sequences than with the
more general MOL16S primers.

Looking at some key columns in the sample report,

.. code:: console

    $ cut -f 1,2,4,7,9,14 summary/SPH16S.samples.onebp.tsv
    <SEE TABLE BELOW>

Or, open ``SPH16S.samples.onebp.xlsx`` in Excel. Focusing on the left hand
columns, you should see:

Things to note:

* In the "Raw FASTQ" column, the control has far fewer raw reads (good).
* The "Cutadapt" column shows reads after SPH16S primer trimming. There are
  hundreds of thousands for the final five samples amplified with these
  primers (good). The first 13 samples were amplified with the MOL16S primers,
  but still have low levels of sequences matching the SPH16S primers (bad).
* The "Read count" column is after applying the minimum abundance threshold
  (here 10). Two negative controls still have reads, lifting the threshold
  to 20 or more would fix this. These are *Sphaerium simile* in mock community
  ``NFSC3PRO3``, and an unknown in river sample ``BIM4M``.

So, using the MOL16S samples as negative controls suggests that for the SPH16S
the default minimum abundance threshold is perhaps overly harsh - but using
*at least* 20 would be wise.

Looking at the same points, I see two problems:

* The control sample BIM8M (SRR5534986) had almost a thousand unwanted MOL16S
  matches, reduced to 551 with a minimum abundance threshold of 10.

* All the SPH16S mock community samples have unwanted MOS16S matches, the
  worst case being SPSC3PRO4 (SRR5534980) with over four hundred reads reduced
  to 108 with the minimum abundance threshold of 10.

To see exactly what is in these two problematic samples, we can turn to the
read report ``summary/MOL16S.reads.onebp.xlsx`` in Excel, or the TSV version
at the command line (using grep to drop the rows ending with a zero count):

The unwanted sequences in the control sample are dominated by a single
sequence (and three variants of it), which were matched to *Sphaerium simile*.

This is consistent with the original author's analysis - although our pipeline
has produced higher read counts:

    Finally, our water blank sample had 71 reads, eight of those being
    singletons with the remaining belonging to *Sphaerium striatinum*
    (Table 9), likely due to amplicon contamination in the lab.

What about the other problematic sample? Again, you can find this in the Excel
read report, or at the command line:

The unwanted mock community sample content is split between *Sphaerium* and
*Dreissena*, and suggest using a minimum threshold of perhaps 50 reads?

Minimum threshold
-----------------

Clearly using a minimum abundance threshold of 10 is too low, and it should be
increased to at perhaps 50 based on this. However, we have one exceptional
sequence present at almost 500 copies. Setting the minimum that high seems
excessive - but perhaps the THAPBI PICT default of 100 is more reasonable?
