Soil Nematode Mock Community
============================

Here we consider a mock community of over 20 soil nematodes (in triplicate),
sequeced separately with four markers, with no-template PCR control blanks:

    taxonomic coverage and availability of reference sequences in choosing
    suitable marker(s)

This example requires creating a database covering the four different marker
primers and known sequences (all of which ought to be properly curated).
