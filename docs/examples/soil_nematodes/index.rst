Soil Nematode Mock Community
============================

Here we consider a mock community of over 20 soil nematodes (in triplicate),
sequeced separately with four markers, with no-template PCR control blanks:

    taxonomic coverage and availability of reference sequences in choosing
    suitable marker(s)

Four different sets of primers where used, which with the current THAPBI PICT
design requires running the pipeline four times.
