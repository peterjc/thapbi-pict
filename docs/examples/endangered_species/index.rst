Endangered Species Mixes 16S etc
================================

This is the most complicated of the examples considered, where most of the
samples are "Experimental mixtures" of multiple plants and animals (plus two
traditional medicine mixtures where the exact content is unknown), which have
all been sequenced with about a dozen different primer pairs for multiple
metabarcoding markers including 16S, COI, cyt-b, matK, rbcL, trnL and ITS2:

    metabarcoding method to identify endangered species in complex samples.

This example requires creating a database of multiple markers (all of which
ought to be properly curated). Both per-marker reports and a pooled report
are generated by the pipeline.
