Microalgal Mock Community 18S
=============================

Building on the previous examples, here we consider seven mock communities of
using six freshwater and six marine microalgae in a staggered gradient.

Two different sets of primers where used targetting the V4 and V8V9 regions
of 18S rRNA (which were sequenced separately), which with the current THAPBI
PICT design requires running the pipeline twice.

The full dataset includes environmental samples too, but a meaningful
examination of these would require building a realistic 18S rRNA database
covering more than just the 12 reference species in the mock community.
