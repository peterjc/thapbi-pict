Pest Insect Mock Communities
============================

Here we consider mock communities of up to six insect species, sequenced with
three pooled markers (18S, 12S, COI), with no-template PCR control blanks:

    protocol for detection of pest insects in bulk trap catches

This example requires creating a database covering the three different marker
primers and known sequences (all of which ought to be properly curated).
