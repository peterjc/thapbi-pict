Classifying sequences
=====================

Running thapbi-pict-classify
----------------------------

.. tip:

   If you don't have the FASTQ files, just the FASTA files, start from here.

The second stage of the pipeline is to merge all the sample specific FASTA
files into one non-redundant FASTA file, and then classify all the unique
sequences in it. These steps can be run separately:

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict fasta-nr -h
    ...
    $ thapbi_pict classify -h
    ...

There are a number of options here, but for the purpose of this worked example
we will stick with the defaults and tell it to look for FASTA files in the
``intermediate/`` directory.

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict fasta-nr -i intermediate/ -o summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.fasta
    ...
    $ thapbi_pict classify -i summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.fasta
    ...

Here we have not set the output folder with ``-o`` or ``--output``, which
means the classify step will default to writing the TSV output files next to
the input FASTA file. There should now be a new FASTA and TSV file:

.. code:: console

    $ ls -1 summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.*
    summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.fasta
    summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.onebp.tsv

Intermediate TSV files
----------------------

For each input FASTA file ``<name>.fasta`` a plain text tab separated variable
(TSV) file is generated named ``<name>.<method>.tsv`` where the default method
is ``onebp`` (which looks for perfect matches or up to one base pair
different). The first line is a header comment line (starting with ``#``)
labelling the columns, which are:

* Unique sequence name in ``<checksum>_<abundance>`` format.
* NCBI taxid of any predictions (semi-colon separated, same order as species)
* Genus-species of any predictions (semi-colon separated, alphabetical)
* Text note field in verbose mode (arbitrary debug text from the tool)

These files are not really intended for human use, but are readable:

.. code:: console

    $ head summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.onebp.tsv
    <SEE TABLE BELOW>

Viewing it like this is not ideal, although there are command line tools which
help. You could open the file in R, Excel, etc:

======================================= ============= ===============================================

The first entry says the most abundance sequence with MD5 checksum
``2e4f0ed53888ed39a2aee6d6d8e02206`` was seen in a total of 163094 reads, and
was classified as *Phytophthora pseudosyringae* (NCBI taxid 221518). Another
common sequence has been matched to two closely related species *Phytophthora
cambivora* (NCBI taxid 53983) and *Phytophthora x cambivora* (NCBI taxid
2056922).

If you are familiar with the command line search tool ``grep`` and the regular
expression syntax, you should find the format of these intermediate TSV files
lends itself to some simple searches. For example, you could see which samples
had matches to *Phytophthora rubi* using ``grep`` as follows:

.. code:: console

    $ grep "Phytophthora rubi" summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.all_reads.onebp.tsv
    d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_899  129364  Phytophthora rubi
    $ grep d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f intermediate/ITS1/*.fasta
    intermediate/ITS1/DNA10MIX_bycopynumber.fasta:>d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_279
    intermediate/ITS1/DNA10MIX_diluted25x.fasta:>d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_349
    intermediate/ITS1/DNA10MIX_undiluted.fasta:>d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_271

The summary reports would also answer this particular question, but this kind
of search can be useful for exploring specific questions.
