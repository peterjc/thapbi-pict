Classifying sequences
=====================

Running thapbi-pict classify
----------------------------

.. tip:

   If you don't have the FASTQ files, just the FASTA files, start from here.

The second stage of the pipeline is to merge all the sample specific FASTA
files into one non-redundant sequence vs sample TSV file, ready to classify all
the unique sequences in it. These steps can be run separately:

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict sample-tally -h
    ...
    $ thapbi_pict classify -h
    ...

There are a number of options here, but for the purpose of this worked example
we will stick with the defaults and tell it to look for FASTA files in the
``intermediate/`` directory.

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict sample-tally -i intermediate/ITS1/*.fasta -o summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.tally.tsv
    ...
    $ thapbi_pict classify -i summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.tally.tsv
    ...

Here we have not set the output folder with ``-o`` or ``--output``, which
means the classify step will default to writing the classifier TSV output file
next to the input tally TSV file. There should now be two new files:

.. code:: console

    $ ls -1 summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.*.tsv
    summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.onebp.tsv
    summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.tally.tsv

If you have the ``biom-format`` Python library installed, there will also be a
``summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.onebp.biom`` file as well, equivalent to the data
in ``summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.tally.tsv`` potentially more useful for export
to other analysis tools.

Intermediate TSV files
----------------------

For each input tally TSV file ``<name>.tally.tsv`` another plain text TSV file
is generated named ``<name>.<method>.tsv`` where the default method is
``onebp`` (which looks for perfect matches or up to one base pair different).
These are both sequence versus sample observation tables of counts, but with
sample metadata in header lines (starting with ``#``) and additional columns
for the amplicon marker sequence, and for the classifier output also the NCBI
taxid(s), and genus-species of any classification(s).

These files are not really intended for human use, but are readable. Here we
skip ten lines of sample metadata at the start, and all the sample-specific
counts in columns 2 to 123, and the sequence in column 124, showing just the
first and final two columns:

.. code:: console

    $ tail -n +10 summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.onebp.tsv | head | cut -f 1,125,126
    <SEE TABLE BELOW>

Viewing it like this is not ideal, although there are command line tools which
help. You could instead open the file in R, Excel, etc:

The first entry says the most abundance sequence with MD5 checksum
``2e4f0ed53888ed39a2aee6d6d8e02206`` was seen in a total of 163094 reads, and
was classified as *Phytophthora pseudosyringae* (NCBI taxid 221518). Another
common sequence has been matched to two closely related species *Phytophthora
cambivora* (NCBI taxid 53983) and *Phytophthora x cambivora* (NCBI taxid
2056922).

If you are familiar with the command line search tool ``grep`` and the regular
expression syntax, you should find the format of these intermediate TSV files
lends itself to some simple searches. For example, you could see which samples
had matches to *Phytophthora rubi* using ``grep`` as follows:

.. code:: console

    $ grep "Phytophthora rubi" summary/thapbi-pict.ITS1.onebp.tsv | cut -f 1,125,126
    ITS1/d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_899  129364  Phytophthora rubi
    $ grep d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f intermediate/ITS1/*.fasta
    intermediate/ITS1/DNA10MIX_bycopynumber.fasta:>d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_279
    intermediate/ITS1/DNA10MIX_diluted25x.fasta:>d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_349
    intermediate/ITS1/DNA10MIX_undiluted.fasta:>d8613e80b8803b13f7ea5d097f8fe46f_271

The summary reports would also answer this particular question, but this kind
of search can be useful for exploring specific questions.
