Fungal Mock Community ITS1 & 2
==============================

Here we consider mock communities of 19 fungal sequences (in both equal and
staggered ratios), prepared with various protocols, and negative controls.

This example is based on the two amplicon sequencing libraries from this paper:

    Bakker (2018) A fungal mock community control for amplicon sequencing
    experiments.
    https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-0998.12760

The first library used a single primer set targetting ITS1, while the second
library used two sets of primers targetting a different region of ITS1, and
ITS2.
