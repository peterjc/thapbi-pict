Fungal Mock Community ITS1 & 2
==============================

Building on the :ref:`custom_database` example, here we consider mock
communities of 19 fungal sequences (in both equal and staggered ratios),
prepared with various protocols, and negative controls.

Three different sets of primers where used (two targetting ITS1, one for ITS2)
which with the current THAPBI PICT design requires running the pipeline three
times.
