Drained fish ponds 12S
======================

This example uses a single 12S marker applied to fishing ponds which were
later drained allowing identification of all the individual fish present:

    Muri *et al.* (2020) Read counts from environmental DNA (eDNA)
    metabarcoding reflect fish abundance and biomass in drained ponds.

We provide a crude 12S database containing fish and off-target mammal and bird
matches.
