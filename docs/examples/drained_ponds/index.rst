======================

This example uses a single marker 12S from fishing ponds which were drained
allowing identification of all the inidividual fish present:

    Muri *et al.* (2020) Read counts from environmental DNA (eDNA)
    metabarcoding reflect fish abundance and biomass in drained ponds.

matches.
