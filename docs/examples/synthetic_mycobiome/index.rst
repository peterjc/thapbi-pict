Synthetic controls with fungal ITS2
===================================

Here we consider some environmental fungi, mock communities, and a synthetic
spike-in control using some of the Illumina data from the following paper:

    Palmer *et al.* (2018) Non-biological synthetic spike-in controls and the
    AMPtk software pipeline improve mycobiome data.
    https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4925
    https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJNA305924

The mock communities have known composition, while the synthetic control has
a mix of 12 artificial sequences which can be easily distinguished from the
biological ITS2 sequences.
