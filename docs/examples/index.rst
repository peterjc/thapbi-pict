Worked Examples
===============

While THAPBI PICT stands for *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classification Tool, with
appropriate primer settings and a custom database, it can be applied to other
organisms and/or barcode marker sequences.

These worked examples using public datasets from published papers include
oomycetes, fungi, microalgae, and bats, and cover markers in ITS1, ITS2, 18S
rRNA, COI and more. The main criteria has been mock communities with known
species composition.

   recycled_water/index
   fungal_mock/index
   microalgal_mock/index
   fecal_sequel/index
   endangered_species/index

For each worked example there is a different sub-folder in the THAPBI PICT
source code under ``examples/`` containing ``setup.sh`` to download the public
data, ``run.sh`` to execute the main analysis discussed, and assorted other
files like ``metadata.tsv``.
