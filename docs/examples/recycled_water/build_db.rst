Building a custom database
==========================

This example is based on the following paper from another research group:

* Redekar *et al.* (2019) Diversity of *Phytophthora*, *Pythium*, and
  *Phytopythium* species in recycled irrigation water in a container nursery.
  https://doi.org/10.1094/PBIOMES-10-18-0043-R

We will build a database using the same public sequences that they used,
accessions given in Supplementary Table 3 in Excel format. We will need to
collect these sequences in FASTA format.

We have taken their list of accessions and species names (ignoring voucher or
isolate numbers), edited some punctuation to match the NCBI taxonomy, added
some missing accession version suffixes, deduplicated, and made a simple
tab-separated plain text table, with 1454 entries. In the setup instructions
for this example you should have got a copy of this file, named
``Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.tsv``, and a matching FASTA file which we
use later.

This table is sorted alphabetically by species then accession, and starts:

========== ===================
Accession  Species
---------- -------------------
HQ643082.1 Achlya ambisexualis
HQ643083.1 Achlya ambisexualis
HQ643084.1 Achlya americana
HQ643085.1 Achlya aquatica
HQ643086.1 Achlya bisexualis
HQ643087.1 Achlya bisexualis
HQ643088.1 Achlya bisexualis
HQ643089.1 Achlya caroliniana
HQ643090.1 Achlya colorata
HQ643091.1 Achlya colorata
========== ===================

Using species given in annotation
---------------------------------

The following snippet of code will download the 1454 accessions in FASTA
format from the EBI - a similar approach could be used to download them
from the NCBI:

.. code:: console

    $ mkdir -p cache
    $ cd cache
    $ for ACC in `cut -f 1 ../Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.tsv`; do curl -L -o "$ACC.fasta" "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/$ACC"; done
    ...
    $ ls -1 *.fasta | wc -l
    1454
    $ cd ..

We will now turn that folder of FASTA files into a single combined file:

.. code:: console

    $ rm -rf Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta
    $ for ACC in `cut -f 1 Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.tsv`; do \
      cat "cache/$ACC.fasta" >> Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta; done
    $ grep -c "^>" Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta
    1454

We can now load this 1454 sequence FASTA file into a new THAPBI PICT database:

.. code:: console

    $ rm -rf first_attempt.sqlite  # delete if already there
    $ thapbi_pict ncbi-import -d first_attempt.sqlite \
      -i Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta -x \
      --left GAAGGTGAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTA \
      --right AGCGTTCTTCATCGATGTGC
    File Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta had 1454 sequences, of which 1451 accepted.
    Of 1451 potential entries, loaded 1451 entries, 0 failed parsing.

So far so good - but only 1451 of the 1454 sequences were loaded.
If you run that again with ``-v`` or ``--verbose`` you will see the missing
three sequences are all *Pythium heterothallicum* entries which were shorter
than the default minimum length.

The ``-x`` (or ``--lax``) turns off species name validation, we'll come back
to this later.

Notice we specified the left and right primers (as discussed in
:ref:`primers <custom_database_primers>`).
In this context THAPBI PICT will look for and discard the left and right
primers in isolation - neither has to be present. This is to cope with
pre-trimmed entries, or cases like the *Oomycetes* markers where some of the
published sequences start immediately after our left primer (which is fine).
Sadly often the start of our target region is missing.

To disable this you can alternatively set the primers to empty strings,
or use the similar ``thapbi_pict curated-import`` command which assumes
pre-trimmed inputs and handles determining the species differently.

Determining the species
-----------------------

Consider ``FJ666127.1`` which Redekar *et al.* (2019) listed as *Phytophthora
aquimorbida* - yet at the time of writing, the file downloaded from
https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/api/fasta/FJ666127.1 is as follows::

    >ENA|FJ666127|FJ666127.1 Phytophthora sp. CCH-2009b isolate 40A6 internal transcribed spacer 1, partial sequence; 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, complete sequence; and internal transcribed spacer 2, partial sequence.

    TGCCTTTGTGGCGGCCGAGAGGACGACCTATTTGGGACGATTGTGCGGCCTCGTGCTGCA
    TCTCAA

Notice that the species name runs into the general description, which
is problematic. Unless THAPBI PICT has a pre-loaded taxonomy to use
for validation, it has to use heuristics to split up this long string -
which is not fully reliable.

If we look at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/FJ666127.1 on the
NCBI website, we see it in GenBank format which is a little different::

    LOCUS       FJ666127                 786 bp    DNA     linear   PLN 09-MAR-2009
    DEFINITION  Phytophthora sp. CCH-2009b isolate 40A6 internal transcribed spacer
                1, partial sequence; 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene, complete sequence;
                and internal transcribed spacer 2, partial sequence.
    ACCESSION   FJ666127
    VERSION     FJ666127.1
    KEYWORDS    .
    SOURCE      Phytophthora aquimorbida
      ORGANISM  Phytophthora aquimorbida
                Eukaryota; Stramenopiles; Oomycetes; Peronosporales;
                Peronosporaceae; Phytophthora.
    ...

The NCBI metadata has the species *Phytophthora aquimorbida* separate
from the author submitted description which starts with an older name,
"Phytophthora sp. CCH-2009b" - which is in fact listed as an alias on
the NCBI taxonomy database under `taxonomy ID 611798
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=611798>`_.

THAPBI PICT offers two solutions. First, the import commands by default
expect a pre-loaded NCBI taxonomy in the database for validation purposes.
This allows ``thapbi_pict ncbi-import`` to try as many words as possible
from the FASTA description in looking for a match in the NCBI taxonomy,
including synonyms. If that fails and lax mode is used (``-x`` or
``--lax``), it falls back on heuristics to identify which part of the
description is the species. The example above didn't preload a
taxonomy. Second, ``thapbi_pict curated-import`` takes the *entire*
FASTA description (after the identifier) as the species name.

Species validation
------------------

THAPBI PICT by default validates imports against the NCBI taxonomy, and
that includes support for known synonyms. This requires downloading the
taxonomy files and running the ``thapbi-pict load-tax`` command.

The NCBI currently provide their taxonomy dump in two formats, old and new.
THAPBI PICT supports both, we'll use the old format as the download is half
the size - we only need the ``names.dmp`` and ``nodes.dmp`` files:

.. code:: console

    $ curl -L -O https://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump_archive/taxdmp_2019-12-01.zip
    ...
    $ unzip -n -d taxdmp_2019-12-01 taxdmp_2019-12-01.zip
    ...
    $ ls -1 taxdmp_2019-12-01/n*.dmp
    taxdmp_2019-12-01/names.dmp
    taxdmp_2019-12-01/nodes.dmp

Now building the database is a two-step process, first importing the
taxonomy, and second importing the sequences.

If you are working with different organisms you will also need to set the
``-a`` or ``--ancestors`` option which defaults to `NCBI taxonomy ID 4762
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=4762>`_ for
*Oomycetes*.

.. code:: console

    $ rm -rf with_validation.sqlite  # remove it if already there
    $ thapbi_pict load-tax -d with_validation.sqlite -t taxdmp_2019-12-01/

    $ thapbi_pict ncbi-import -d with_validation.sqlite \
      -i Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta \
      --left GAAGGTGAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTA \
      --right AGCGTTCTTCATCGATGTGC
    File Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_download.fasta had 1454 sequences, of which 1447 accepted.
    Of 1451 potential entries, 0 unparsable, 4 failed sp. validation, 1447 OK.
    Could not validate 4 different species names

Notice this time we ran ``thapbi_pict ncbi-import`` without the ``-x``
(``--lax``) option, and it complained about two species names and two entries
- but which? If you repeat this but add ``-v`` or ``--verbose`` to the import
command you can see:

- *Phytophthora lagoariana* from
  `EF590256.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/EF590256.1>`_,
  which the NCBI says should be "*Phytophthora* sp. 'lagoariana'"
- *Phytophthora personensis* from
  `EU301169.2 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/EU301169.2>`_,
  which was not in this revision of the tax dump.
- *Phytophthora novaeguinee* from
  `EU035774.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/EU035774.1>`_,
  which the NCBI says should be "*Phytophthora* sp. *novaeguinee*"
- *Globisporangium rostratifingens* from
  `HQ643764.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643764.1>`_,
  which was at the time of this tax dump *Pythium rostratifingen*.

Strict validation has its downsides when combined with uncurated metadata
and unrecorded synonyms. It is also a moving target - in this case if rather
than December 2019, we had used the January 2020 NCBI taxonomy, this merged
*Phytophthora sansomea* (taxid 358102) into *Phytophthora sansomeana*
(taxid 555429) without setting an alias - affecting five more accessions here.

In this case the problem wasn't actually splitting the species name from the
free text, but rather the (older) species name in the description did not
match the (newer) annotated species name used in the NCBI taxonomy, or one of
the defined synonyms.

One fix would be to download the data in GenBank, EMBL or TinySeq XML format
rather than FASTA, which would give the species separately. Alternatively,
THAPBI PICT will accept curated species data as described next.


Curated import
--------------

The ``thapbi_pict curated-import`` used above differs from the
``thapbi_pict ncbi-import`` command in two key points. First, by default it
expects the sequences to be pre-trimmed (it does not do primer trimming).
Second, it does not use heuristics but simply assumes the FASTA description
line is an identifier followed by the species name *only*.

We have provided file ``Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.fasta`` which contains
primer trimmed versions of the full sequences of each accession, plus the
species name from ``Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.tsv`` which was based on
those given in Redekar *et al.* (2019) Supplementary Table 3 but with some
light curation to better match the NCBI usage.

The sequencing trimming ought to be very close to that used in the Redekar
*et al.* (2019) paper's database. This file was constructed with a short Python
script parsing the information in ``Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.tsv`` and
the downloaded full sequences.
Then ``cutadapt -g GAAGGTGAAGTCGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGGAAGGATCATTA ...``
found and removed 64 left prefixes. This was followed by running
``cutadapt -a GCACATCGATGAAGAACGCT ...`` which trimmed 1439 sequences (99.9%)
and warned that the "adapter" might be incomplete because the sequence
preceeding it was highly conserved. That left 1451 sequences, but with many
duplicates. This was made non-redundant giving 841 unique sequences with
de-duplicated entries recorded with semi-colon separated FASTA title lines.

Now, let's load the FASTA file into a new THAPBI PICT database with the NCBI
taxonomy pre-loaded, but not enforced (``-x`` or ``--lax`` mode):

.. code:: console

    $ rm -rf Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.sqlite  # remove it if already there
    $ thapbi_pict load-tax -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.sqlite -t taxdmp_2019-12-01/
    $ thapbi_pict curated-import -x \
      -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.sqlite \
      -i Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.fasta
    File Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.fasta had 841 sequences, of which 838 accepted.
    Of 1451 potential entries, loaded 1451 entries, 0 failed parsing.

Again, just three short sequences were rejected - giving in total 1451 entries.
However this time the vast majority are recorded with an NCBI taxid, just four
exceptions (visible if you run the last command with ``-v`` or ``--verbose``):

- *Phytophthora taxon aquatilis* from
  `FJ666126.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/FJ666126.1>`_,
  which the NCBI say should be *Phytophthora* sp. CCH-2009a
- *Phytophthora fragaefolia* from
  `AB305065.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/AB305065.1>`_,
  which the NCBI say should be *Phytophthora fragariaefolia*.
- *Phytophthora citricola sensu stricto* from
  `FJ560913.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/FJ560913.1>`_,
  which the NCBI say should be just *Phytophthora citricola*.
- *Phytopythium sp. amazonianum* from
  `HQ261725.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ261725.1>`_,
  which the NCBI say should be *Pythium* sp. 'amazonianum'.

None of these are clear cut (there were a lot more conflicts, mostly down to
differences in punctuation, already addressed in preparing the TSV and FASTA
file).

If you left off the ``-x`` (or ``--lax``) option, those four would not have
been imported into the database.


Taxonomic conflicts
-------------------

The ITS1 region is not ideal as a barcode sequence.  In the *Phytophthora*
there are many cases where the same marker is shared by multiple species.
The ``thapbi_pict conflicts`` command is provided to check for this, or
worse -- conflicts at genus level:

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict conflicts -h
    ...

Let's run this on the custom database, with output to a file:

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict conflicts -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.sqlite -o conflicts.tsv; echo "(Return code $?)"
    Loaded taxonomy for 838 sequences from DB
    (Return code 3)

This produces a plain text tab separated table ``conflicts.tsv`` which starts
as follows:

================================ ======= =====================================
MD5                              Level   Conflicts
-------------------------------- ------- -------------------------------------

...                              ...     ...
================================ ======= =====================================

There are 77 species level conflicts, some of which might be subspecies etc.
However, more concerning is three genus level conflicts - all involving
*Pythium*.

One way to see which accessions are a problem is filtering the dump command
output (introduced properly in :ref:`custom_database_examine`), e.g.

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict dump -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.sqlite \
      | cut -f 1-5 | grep 3550a51c172b547e7626e8f99a942341
    HQ643393.1  Phytopythium  oedochilum  3550a51c172b547e7626e8f99a942341
    HQ643394.1  Phytopythium  oedochilum  3550a51c172b547e7626e8f99a942341
    HQ643712.1  Pythium       oedichilum  3550a51c172b547e7626e8f99a942341
    Wrote 1451 txt format entries

In this case the NCBI has
`HQ643393.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643393.1>`_,
`HQ643394.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643394.1>`_, and
`HQ643712.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643712.1>`_ all
labelled as *Phytopythium oedochilum*, which has *Pythium oedichilum* listed
as a homotypic synonym. We did not find this sequence in the dataset, but if
it had been it is likely this oversight would have been fixed by the authors.

On the other hand, ``87e588784b04ba5f4538ff91acb50c0f`` is from
`HQ643136.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643136.1>`_ labelled
as *Lagenidium caudatum*
`HQ643539.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643539.1>`_ labelled
as *Pythium flevoense*
- and the NCBI still lists these as separate species in separate family.

While ``9bb2ab5b9f88256516f2ae618c16a62e`` is from multiple accessions for
*Pythium ultimum* or *Pythium ultimum var. ultimum* plus one odd one out --
`HQ643127.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ643127.1>`_ labelled
as *Brevilegnia gracilis*. Again, currently listed as a separate species in
a separate family.

Those assignments might have changed since this was written, using the
January 2020 NCBI taxonomy.


Curated import with synonyms
----------------------------

We can solve *Pythium oedichilum* being moved under *Phytopythium* by
pre-loading the NCBI taxonomy for its synonyms, but still run in lax mode (as
otherwise quite a few entries are rejected):

.. code:: console

    $ rm -rf Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_synonyms.sqlite  # remove if present
    $ thapbi_pict load-tax \
      -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_synonyms.sqlite \
      -t taxdmp_2019-12-01/
    ...
    $ thapbi_pict curated-import -x \
      -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_synonyms.sqlite \
      -i Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3.fasta
    $ thapbi_pict conflicts -d Redekar_et_al_2019_sup_table_3_synonyms.sqlite
    Loaded taxonomy for 838 sequences from DB
    #MD5                              Level    Conflicts
    87e588784b04ba5f4538ff91acb50c0f  genus    Lagenidium;Pythium
    9bb2ab5b9f88256516f2ae618c16a62e  genus    Brevilegnia;Globisporangium
    ff35f216832110904cc6fd1c9def33fd  genus    Achlya;Saprolegnia
    077ae505c0ad210aa4c071417a4f2f9a  species  Saprolegnia monilifera;Saprolegnia unispora
    ...

This solved the conflict we expected, but introduced a new conflict on
``ff35f216832110904cc6fd1c9def33fd`` from
`HQ644008.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ644008.1>`_ and
`HQ644009.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ644009.1>`_ as
labelled as *Saprolegnia subterranea*, and
`HQ644006.1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/HQ644006.1>`_ labelled
as *Saprolegnia sp. CAL-2011 rodrigueziana*, but which the NCBI says is now
part of *Achlya rodrigueziana*. Also, *Pythium ultimum* is now a basionym
for *Globisporangium ultimum*.

It might be better to update the *Pythium oedichilum* entries in the curated
TSV and FASTA file to say *Phytopythium*? Or, depending on your motivation,
just leave the species assignments as is.

Taxonomy is fluid, so if using any single authority, make sure to document
which version (e.g. month and year for the NCBI taxonomy).
