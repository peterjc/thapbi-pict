Environmental Oomycetes ITS1 (& COI)
====================================

Here we re-analyse a published dataset from a different group:

    Landa *et al.* (2021) Diversity of Phytophthora Species Detected in
    Disturbed and Undisturbed British Soils Using High-Throughput Sequencing
    Targeting ITS rRNA and COI mtDNA Regions.
    https://doi.org/10.3390/f12020229

The ITS sequencing used the same PCR primers as the THAPBI PICT defaults, so
makes a nice example to follow with our default database of *Phytophthora*
ITS1 data.

In this example we do not look at their COI sequencing, which would require
building a custom database of markers.
