Example: Microalgal Mock Community
==================================

Building on the previous examples, here we consider seven mock communities of
using six freshwater and six marine microalgae in a staggered gradient.

Two different sets of primers where used targetting the V4 and V8V9 regions
of 18S rRNA, which with the current THAPBI PICT design requires running the
pipeline twice.
