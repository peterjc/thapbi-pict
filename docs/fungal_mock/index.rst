Example: Fungal Mock Community
==============================

Building on the :ref:`custom_database`, here we consider mock communities of
19 fungal sequences (in both equal and staggered ratios), prepared with
various protocols, and negative controls.

Three different sets of primers where used (two targetting ITS1, one for ITS2)
which with the current THAPBI PICT design requires running the pipeline three
times.
