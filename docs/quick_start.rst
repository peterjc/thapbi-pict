Quick Start
===========

Here we describe a simplified use of the THAPBI PICT tool to assess a single
Illumina MiSeq sequencing run. The input data is a set of paired FASTQ files
(one for each sample), perhaps barcoded samples from a 96-well plate.

.. image:: images/pipeline.svg
   :alt: Flowchart summarising THAPBI PICT pipeline, from raw paired FASTQ files to reports.

In this illustrative flow chart of the default pipeline, the input paired
FASTQ files are green, the intermediate per-sample FASTA and TSV files are
yellow, and the output reports are in orange. The individual steps of the
pipeline are dark blue boxes, and the ITS1 database is a pale blue cylinder.

We will now describe how to run the ``thapbi_pict pipeline`` command, which
will process the samples, make classifications, and summary reports.

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict pipeline -h
    ...

Setup
-----

We assume you have a new folder dedicated to this analysis, with a sub folder
``raw_data/`` which contains the demultiplexed paired FASTQ files which are
named like ``<sample_name>_R1.fastq.gz`` and ``<sample_name>_R2.fastq.gz``
as provided by your sequencing centre. The tool understands a few widely used
naming patterns. We recommend that you *do* *not* decompress the FASTQ files
(as ``<sample_name>_R1.fastq`` and ``<sample_name>_R2.fastq``, leaving them
gzip compressed is preferable for disk space.

.. code:: console

    $ cd /path/to/my/project/
    $ ls raw_data/*.fastq.gz
    ...

We will make two additional sub-folders, ``intermediate/`` (for the per-sample
prepared FASTA files and classifier prediction TSV files), and ``summary/``
for the folder level reports.

.. code:: console

    $ mkdir intermediate/
    $ mkdir summary/

Running
-------

With that done, we run the ``thapbi_pict pipeline`` command, which for a
single 96 sample Illumina MiSeq run should take perhaps up to 20 minutes (the
edit-graph can be most of this).

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict pipeline -i raw_data/ -s intermediate/ -o summary/
    Starting to prepare sample intermediate/<sample_name>.fasta ...
    ...
    Expanded 3645 ITS1 sequences from DB into cloud of 4144465 1bp different variants
    Running onebp classifer on intermediate/<sample_name>.fasta
    ...
    Wrote summary/thapbi-pict.samples.*
    Wrote summary/thapbi-pict.reads.*
    ...
    Wrote summary/thapbi-pict.edit-graph.xgmml
    All done!

This is robust to being interupted and restarted (as long as you are not
changing settings), and will reuse intermediate files, and not recompute
the edit-graph (which can be very slow):

.. code:: console

    $ thapbi_pict pipeline  -i raw_data/ -s intermediate/ -o summary
    WARNING: Skipping intermediate/<sample_name>.fasta as already exists
    ...
    Running onebp classifer on intermediate/<sample_name>.fasta
    WARNING: Skipping intermediate/<sample_name>.onebp.tsv as already exists
    ...
    Wrote summary/thapbi-pict.samples.*
    Wrote summary/thapbi-pict.reads.*
    WARNING: Skipping summary/thapbi-pict.edit-graph.xgmml as already exists
    All done!

All being well, this will produce a set of report files, with names matching
``thapbi-pict.*`` as follows:

.. code:: console

    $ ls -1 thapbi-pict.*
    thapbi-pict.reads.tsv
    thapbi-pict.reads.xlsx
    thapbi-pict.samples.tsv
    thapbi-pict.samples.txt
    thapbi-pict.edit-graph.xgmml

.. WARNING::

    This minimal example omits a key consideration - telling the tool which
    samples are negative controls, and/or manually setting the minimum read
    abundance.

Intermediate FASTA files
------------------------

The first stage of the pipeline can be run separately as the
``thapbi_pict prepare`` command. Here each pair of FASTQ files named something
like ``<sample_name>_R1.fastq.gz`` and ``<sample_name>_R2.fastq.gz`` is
processed to give a much smaller FASTA format file ``<sample_name>.fasta``
containing all the unique sequences from that sample which resemble an ITS1
sequence (or a synthetic control).

In these FASTA files, each sequence is named as ``<checksum>_<abundance>``
where the `MD5 checksum <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5>`_ of the
sequence and is used as a unique shorthand - a 32 character string of the
digits ``0`` to ``9`` and lower cases letters ``a`` to ``f`` inclusive.
These MD5 checksums are used later in the pipeline, including in reports.

Intermediate TSV files
----------------------

The second stage of the pipeline can be run separately as the
``thapbi_pict classify`` command. Here each species predictions are
made for each sequence in the prepared FASTA files, generating a
tab separated variable (TSV) file where the first column is the
sequence name in ``<checksum>_<abundance>`` format.

Sample Reports
--------------

Two of the output reports from the pipeline can also be generated by the
``thapbi_pict sample-report`` sub-command:

* Human readable file ``thapbi-pict.samples.txt`` (plain text).
* Computer readable file ``thapbi-pict.samples.tsv`` (tab separated
  variables, TSV) which can be openend in R, Excel, or similar.

These aim to give a summary of the species identified within each sample. The
human readable report deliberately does not include read counts as the method
is only semi-quantative - as long as it passed the minimum read abundance,
any unique sequence is included.

The computer readable file is intended to facilitate downstream analysis.

Read Reports
------------

The next two output reports from the pipeline can also be generated by the
``thapbi_pict read-summary`` sub-command:

* Plain table ``thapbi-pict.reads.tsv`` (tab separated variables, TSV) which
  can be opened in R, Excel, or similar.
* Visually formatted table ``thapbi-pict.reads.xlsx`` (Microsoft Excel
  format), with the same content but with colors etc applied.

This read report has a row for each unique sequences. The first columns are
the unique sequence MD5 checksum, any species prediction, the sequence itself,
the number of samples it detected in above the threshold, and the total number
of times this was seen (in samples where it was above the threshold). Then
the main columns (one per sample) list the abundance of each unique sequence
in that sample (if above the threshold).

In the Excel version, conditional formatting is used to highlight the non-zero
counts with a red background.

Edit Graph
----------

The final output report from the pipeline can also be generated by the
``thapbi_pict edit-graph`` sub-command:

* Edit-distance graph ``thapbi-pict.edit-graph.xgmml`` (XGMML, eXtensible
  Graph Markup and Modeling Language) which we recommend opening in `Cytoscape
  <https://cytoscape.org/>`_.

Note that ``thapbi_pict edit-graph`` supports other node-and-edge graph file
formats, and can produce a static PDF image as well using `GraphViz
<http://graphviz.org/>`_ and other dependencies.

Next Steps
----------

This minimal example omits a key consideration which is telling the tool which
of the samples are your negative controls and/or manually setting the minimum
read abundance.

Also, interpreting the main reports is much easier if you can provide suitably
formatted :ref:`metadata <metadata>`. Happily, you can re-run the pipeline and
it will re-use any already generated intermediate files.
