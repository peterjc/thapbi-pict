"""setuptools based setup script for THAPBI PICT.

This uses setuptools which is now the standard python mechanism for installing
packages (and is used internally by the tool pip). If you have downloaded and
uncompressed the THAPBI PICT source code, or fetched it from git, for the
simplest installation try one of these commands::

    pip install .

Or::

    python setup.py install

Typically however, since we have released this software on PyPI, you don't
need to download it first. Instead just run::

    pip install thapbi_pict

Once installed, you should be able to run the tool using:

   thapbi_pict

Or start it as a module::

   python -m thapbi_pict

Either should find the installed copy of the Python code.
