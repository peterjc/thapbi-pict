# the simplest way to get them included in a wheel for install:
recursive-include thapbi_pict/hmm phytophthora_its1.*
include thapbi_pict/ITS1_DB.sqlite

# Deliberately not bothering to anything in database via wildcards.
# e.g. NCBI taxonomy or symlinks to control plate positive controls.

# The following is better than a blanket include wildcard * but
# this still risks unwanted includes of any working files:
recursive-include tests *.sh *.txt *.tsv *.fasta *.fastq.gz
